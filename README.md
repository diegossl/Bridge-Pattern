# Bridge pattern

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## Setup

To execute the project, it will be necessary to install the dependencies by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn install
```

To execute the project it is necessary to transpile the Typescript code to JavaScript. To do this, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn tsc
```

### Use

To execute the project already transpiled into JavaScript, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn start
```
